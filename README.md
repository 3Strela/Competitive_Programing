# Competitive Programing
This Repositorie was created by me to manage all the [sites](https://github.com/3Strela/Competitive_Programing/blob/master/Studies/README.md) and [competitions](https://github.com/3Strela/Competitive_Programing/blob/master/Competitions/README.md) that bring me knowledge about data structures or paradigms, which I use on my competitive programming's journey. 

I know I need to learn more about everthing related to CP.

Because it's funny and challenger. 

This's the reason why I am here.

To learn and "discover" some data structures and paradigms.

In the end, I want to be good in CP and good at solve programming problems.
